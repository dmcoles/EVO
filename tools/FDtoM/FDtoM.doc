                            1. Legal Stuff
                            ==============

 FDtom is placed in the Public Domain for the Amiga.

 Feel free to use it, but AT YOUR OWN RISK, as I cannot be considered
 responsible for any damage caused to your system. Have Fun!


                            2. What is it?
                            ==============

 - There was no Tool to Convert '.fd'-Files to MODULE's for Amiga_E,
   so I write my own.

 - FDtom is a Shell-only program for all Amiga's.
 - FDtom converts a Standard '.fd'-File in the special Form, needed by
   Amiga_E. (The Library-Function-File "libname.m" for Amiga_E, and  a
   "libname_lvo.m" with all LVOFUNKTIONNAME's for the Inline-Assembler).
 - FDtom also generates "libname_lvo.i" for any Assembler (ASM-Switch).


                            3. How to use
                            =============
 OS < 2.0:
 - FDtom ignores SPACE and TAB and take the Rest of the Commandline
   as the only Filename.

---
 OS >= 2.0:

 -FDtom uses the standard parser of OS 2.x. Start it with  a `?' as
  argument and you will see the Pattern:

    FILES/A/M,RESOURCE/S,DEVICE/S,ASM/S

 -FILES/A/M:  You must put one or more Filename as Argument(s).

 -RESOURCE/S: FDtom will write the correct LVO-File for the E-Assembler,
              the Name in the MODULE-Header is now correct.

 -DEVICE/S:   The Name in the MODULE-Header is now correct.

 -ASM/S:      FDtom creates a "libname_lvo.i"-File for other Assemblers.


---
 ALL OS
 - There is no Pattern-Matching for the Filename(s).
 - The extensions '.fd' and '_lib.fd' are optional.
 - The Output-Files are written to the Current Directory
 - AmigaE is unable to use Funktion's with Offset: -6,-12,-18, and -24,
   but the LVO-File for the Assembler is ok.




                             4. Example
                             ==========
  
; FDtom - Example :
;
;  Go to the Destination-Dir
  CD EModules:

;  Convert ( OS <2.0)
  FDtom fd:arp
  FDtom fd:exec
  FDtom fd:dos


;  Convert ( OS >=2.0)
  FDtom fd:asl fd:exec fd:dos fd:misc

; That's all :-))
;

---------

 Dont't forget to add the new 'MODULE' to your Sources.

 E-Usage:
        MODULE 'libname'
        NewFunction(newargs)

 ASM-Usage:
        MODULE 'libname_lvo'
        JSR    LVONEWFUNCTION(A6)

 I  have used Amiga_E to write FDtom.  What?  E ?!  Yea!  Go and
