TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USING THE EDBG SOURCECODE

* modifying or reusing part or whole of the EDBG code for your
  own project is always allowed: giving credit is encouraged.
* making new versions of EDBG public is discouraged in
  general. if you still feel that need, try in this order:
  - suggest the extension to the maintainer of the "official"
    EDBG, currently Jason Hulance.
  - cooperate with other people that may be working on a
    custom EDBG (try discussing this on the E mailing list).
  - the EDBG core (eexe.e) has been programmed to be
    used by various different programs/user-interfaces.
    Try making your own debugging tool that uses eexe.e
    unmodified.
  - if you HAVE to start your own spin-off project, make sure
    your release is heavily marked as being different from the
    official version while still giving credit. e.g.
    "Harry's TurboDebug v1.0a featuring runtime type analysis,
    based on Wouter and Jason's original EDBG v3.3a".
    After you start your own version, don't come and
    bother us about making it the official version.
    Doing your own commercial version or anything else related
    to money won't be tolerated at all.

The purpose of this release is first and foremost educational.

If you intend to do something with this code which doesn't
seem to be covered by the above, ask me (Wouter) or Jason first.
