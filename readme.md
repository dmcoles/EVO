GRIO Amiga E Compiler is a derivative of the original Amiga E compiler written
by Wouter van Oortmerssen. GEC (GRIO Amiga E Compiler) was originally developed
by GRIO (ogrio at o2.pl) between 1999 and 2003.

It adds many new features, bug fixes and optimisations including object
UNIONs, string merging, non word-aligned objects and many more.

E is an object oriented / procedural / unpure functional higher programming
language, mainly influenced by languages such as C++, Ada, Lisp etc.  It is a
general-purpose programming language, and the Amiga implementation is
specifically targeted at programming system applications.

In 2021 I decided to switch to GEC for one of my projects and made some
additional bug fixes and improvements including a CONT loop continue,
ANDALSO and ORELSE operators that provide short circuit evaluation and
displaying line numbers of unused variables/procedures.

If you want to assemble this code yourself you should use Asm-One. The
source is all contained within a single source file and requires no additional
resources.
