E-VO Amiga E Compiler is a derivative of the original Amiga E compiler written
by Wouter van Oortmerssen. It adds many new features, bug fixes and
optimisations including object UNIONs, string merging, non word-aligned
objects and many more.

This version includes all the enhancements that were developed by GRIO
(ogrio at o2.pl) between 1999 and 2003 for his GRIO E Compiler (GEC) plus
some ideas from the creativE and YAEC compilers plus many more of my own
improvements.

E is an object oriented / procedural / unpure functional higher programming
language, mainly influenced by languages such as C++, Ada, Lisp etc.  It is a
general-purpose programming language, and the Amiga implementation is
specifically targeted at programming system applications.

In 2021 I decided to switch to GEC for one of my projects and made some
additional bug fixes and improvements including a CONT loop continue,
ANDALSO and ORELSE operators that provide short circuit evaluation and
displaying line numbers of unused variables/procedures.

If you want to assemble this code yourself you should use Asm-One. The
source is all contained within a single source file and requires no additional
resources.

The program is released into the public domain for anyone to use however they
wish with no restrictions apart from that the program should not be sold for
profit.
