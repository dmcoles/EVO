E-VO Amiga E Compiler is a derivative of the original Amiga E compiler written
by Wouter van Oortmerssen. It adds many new features, bug fixes and
optimisations including object UNIONs, string merging, non word-aligned
objects and many more.

Just a small sample of the changes in this release:

   added PSIZEOF operator
   
   added ARRAYSIZE operator
   
   added SelectFirst function
   
   added debug symbols for methods
   
   allow CONT and EXIT within SELECT statement
   
   skip NameFromFH call on kick 1.3 meaning the compiler now works
     on that OS again
   
E is an object oriented / procedural / unpure functional higher programming
language, mainly influenced by languages such as C++, Ada, Lisp etc.  It is a
general-purpose programming language, and the Amiga implementation is
specifically targeted at programming system applications.

If you want to assemble this code yourself you should use Asm-One or Vasm. The
source is all contained within a single source file and requires no additional
resources.

The program is released into the public domain for anyone to use however they
wish with no restrictions apart from that the program should not be sold for
profit.
